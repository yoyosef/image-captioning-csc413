# Image Captioning Project CSC413

## Overview
* This repository contains the training code for a couple image-captioning models. 
* The Flickr8k dataset was used to train the models. 
* Validation and Evaluation code using BLEU.
* The training and validation code is all original while the encoder decoder models were modified for the project and are from other repositories (links below)
